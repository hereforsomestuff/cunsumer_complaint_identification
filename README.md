Project Description: "Consumer Complaint Identification"

Objective: The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately identifies and categorizes consumer complaints.

Decription:

Consumer complaint identification is the process of recognizing and categorizing complaints made by consumers. This can be done through various means, such as analyzing customer feedback and comments, monitoring social media, and reviewing customer service logs. The purpose of consumer complaint identification is to identify the most common issues and concerns that consumers have, so that companies can address these issues and improve their products or services.

Consumer complaints can range from problems with products or services, to issues with billing or customer service. By identifying and categorizing these complaints, companies can prioritize and address the most pressing issues, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce the risk of negative publicity. Consumer complaint identification can also help companies identify trends and patterns in customer feedback, which can inform future business decisions and product development.

"Consumer complaint identification" is important for several reasons:

Improving customer satisfaction: By identifying and categorizing consumer complaints, companies can understand the most common issues and concerns that customers have and take steps to address them. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Identifying trends and patterns: Consumer complaint identification can help companies identify trends and patterns in customer feedback, which can inform future business decisions and product development. For example, if many customers are complaining about a particular aspect of a product or service, the company can focus on improving that aspect to better meet customer needs.

Reducing negative publicity: Addressing consumer complaints quickly and effectively can help reduce the risk of negative publicity and reputational damage. Consumers who feel heard and valued are less likely to publicly criticize a company and more likely to remain loyal customers.

Enhancing product development: By understanding the needs and concerns of customers, companies can develop better products and services that meet their needs. Consumer complaint identification can provide valuable insights into what customers want and help companies create products and services that are more likely to be successful.

Improving customer service: By categorizing complaints, companies can prioritize the most pressing issues and ensure that customer service representatives are equipped to address them. This can lead to improved customer service and a better overall customer experience.

Data: The project will use consumer complaint data from [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/). The data will include  
1. Date received  
2. Product   
3. Sub-product   
4. Issue
5. Sub-issue 
6. Consumer complaint narrative 

Methodology: The project will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to pre-process the text data and extract relevant information. The data will be trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent classification algorithm. The following libraries have been used:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. nltk
4. stopwords
5. re
6. string
7. sklearn
8. SGDClassifier


Results: The results of the project will be a machine learning model that can accurately identify and categorize consumer complaints. The model will be tested on new, unseen data to ensure that it generalizes well to new data.

Conclusion: This project will provide valuable insights into the most common issues and concerns of consumers, and will help companies improve their products and services and increase customer satisfaction. The results of this project will also inform future business decisions and product development, and will help companies better understand and respond to their customers' needs.
